Basic Project: Intelligent Waste Management System
==================================================

Problem Statement:
------------------

-   Inefficient waste management leads to environmental pollution and health risks. Traditional waste collection methods often result in unnecessary trips for garbage collectors and overflowing containers, causing inconvenience to residents.

Solution:
---------

-   An Intelligent Waste Management System that utilizes IoT sensors to monitor the fill level of garbage containers in real-time and optimize waste collection routes accordingly.

### Necessary Components:

-   IoT sensors (ultrasonic or infrared) to measure the fill level of garbage containers
-   Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to process sensor data
-   Wi-Fi or GSM module for data transmission
-   Cloud server or IoT platform to store and analyze data
-   Mobile or web application for user interface and administration
-   Web dashboard for overview of container status and waste collection optimization

### Operation:

1.  Install IoT sensors on garbage containers to measure the fill level. (3 fill levels: low, medium, high) and classify the type of waste (organic, recyclable, non-recyclable).
2.  Connect the sensors to the microcontroller.
3.  The microcontroller collects data from the sensors and sends it to the cloud server or IoT platform.
4.  Develop a **mobile application for local residents** to view **nearby garbage containers**, their **fill level**, and the type of waste they can deposit. Users can **choose where to dispose of their waste based on container availability and waste type**.
5.  Create a **web page** for waste management companies to have an **overview of each container in each city**, showing the fill level and waste type. The dashboard allows **real-time data visualization and report generation on waste collection efficiency in different areas**. Based on the dashboard data, the company can plan **waste collection routes more efficiently**, prioritizing containers with higher fill levels and optimizing the management of different types of waste.
7.  **Place a panel on the garbage container** that alerts whether the garbage is full or not, thus avoiding **unnecessary stops** for garbage collectors.


### Challenges:

-   Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of IoT sensors.
-   Developing an intuitive and user-friendly mobile application for local residents.
-   Integrating existing waste management systems with the new intelligent management solution.
