### Project Overview: Intelligent Waste Management System

#### Problem:

Inefficient waste management leads to environmental pollution, public health risks, and high operational costs due to traditional collection methods.

#### Proposed Solution:

Development of an Intelligent Waste Management System that utilizes IoT (Internet of Things) technology to monitor and optimize waste collection in real-time.

#### Key Components:

1.  Ultrasonic Sensors: Installed in waste bins to measure the fill level.
2.  Microcontroller: Responsible for collecting and processing sensor data.
3.  Connectivity: Use of Wi-Fi or GSM module to transmit data to a cloud server.
4.  Cloud Server or IoT Platform: Stores and analyzes sensor data, providing insights and management functionalities.
5.  Mobile Application for Residents: Allows residents to locate nearby waste bins, view their fill level, and choose where to dispose of their waste based on occupancy.
6.  Web Dashboard for Waste Management Companies: Provides an overview of all waste bins under the company's responsibility, with detailed information on fill level and collection efficiency reports.

#### Operation:

1.  Ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor the fill level of waste bins.
2.  Data is sent to the microcontroller, which transmits it to the cloud server.
3.  The mobile application enables residents to access real-time information and make informed waste disposal decisions.
4.  Waste management companies use the web dashboard to monitor and optimize collection operations based on real-time sensor data.

#### Challenges:

-   Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of ultrasonic sensors.
-   Developing intuitive user interfaces for the mobile application and web dashboard.
-   Integrating the new system with existing waste management systems.
-   Maintaining connectivity and performing adequate system maintenance over time.
