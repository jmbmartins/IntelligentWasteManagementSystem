# Project Overview: Intelligent Waste Management System 


Problem: Inefficient waste management leads to environmental pollution, public health risks, and high operational costs due to traditional collection methods.


Proposed Solution: Development of an Intelligent Waste Management System that utilizes IoT (Internet of Things) technology to monitor and optimize waste collection in real-time. The system will be powered by solar energy, making it sustainable and reducing operational costs. Additionally, GPS technology will be incorporated to track the location of each waste bin.

### Key Components:

1.  Ultrasonic Sensors (3): Installed in waste bins to measure the fill level.
2.  Servo Motor (1): Enable the sweeping motion of the ultrasonic sensors for scanning the environment. The servo motors will help in obtaining 3D coordinates from different angles for mapping purposes.
3.  GPS Module: Installed in each waste bin to track its location.
4.  Microcontroller (Arduino): Responsible for collecting and processing sensor data.
5.  Connectivity: Use of Wi-Fi to transmit data to a cloud server.
6.  Cloud Server: Firebase is used to store and analyze sensor data.
7.  Solar Panels: Installed on or near the waste bins to capture solar energy. 
8.  Charge Controller: Regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels.
9.  Battery Storage: Stores the energy generated by the solar panels for use when there's no sunlight.
10.  DC-DC Converter: Converts the battery voltage to the required voltage for the sensors, microcontroller, and GPS module.
11. Matrix LED 8x8: Installed in each waste bin to display the fill level.
12. Mobile Application (Flutter) for Residents: Allows residents to locate nearby waste bins, view their fill level, and choose where to dispose of their waste based on occupancy. It also provides intelligent assistance by suggesting the best disposal option based on the user's location and the fill levels of nearby bins.
13. Web Dashboard for Waste Management Companies: Provides an overview of all waste bins under the company's responsibility, with detailed information on fill level, location, and collection efficiency reports. The company can manage the waste bins by adding, editing, or deleting bins.

### Operation:

1.  Solar panels capture solar energy, which is regulated by the charge controller and stored in batteries.
2.  The DC-DC converter provides the required power to the ultrasonic sensors, microcontroller, GPS module, and Matrix LED 8x8.
3.  Ultrasonic sensors installed in waste bins measure the fill level more accurately and comprehensively.
4.  GPS module tracks the location of each waste bin.
5.  Data is sent to the microcontroller, which transmits it to the Firebase cloud server.
6.  The Matrix LED 8x8 displays the fill level in different colors: Green for "Low", Yellow for "Moderate", and Red for "High".
7.  The mobile application enables residents to access real-time information and make informed waste disposal decisions.
8.  Waste management companies use the web dashboard to monitor and optimize collection operations based on real-time sensor data and location information.

#### Challenges:

1.  Ensuring the solar panels receive adequate sunlight and are properly maintained.
2.  Managing the battery storage to ensure there's enough power during periods of no sunlight.
3.  Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of ultrasonic sensors and GPS module.
4.  Developing intuitive user interfaces for the mobile application and web dashboard.
5.  Integrating the new system with existing waste management systems.
6.  Maintaining connectivity and performing adequate system maintenance over time.

#### Expected Benefits:

1.  Reduction in operational costs as the system uses a renewable energy source.
2.  Reduction in environmental pollution and public health risks.
3.  Optimization of waste collection operations, leading to cost savings.
4.  Active community participation in waste management.
5.  Improved transparency and efficiency in urban waste management.
6.  Enhanced tracking and location accuracy of waste bins.
7.  Real-time visual indication of fill levels for residents and waste management personnel.

### Garanting Reability and Accuracy of Ultrasonic Sensors

#### Reviewing Article "3D Surface Mapping using Ultrasonic Sensors"

Material Used:
 - Ultrasonic Sensors
 - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
 - Servo Motors: Employ servo motors to enable the sweeping motion of the ultrasonic sensors for scanning the environment. The servo motors will help in obtaining 3D coordinates from different angles for mapping    purposes.
 - PC/Laptop: Utilize a computer to receive and process the data collected by the ultrasonic sensors. Use software like Processing and Matlab for data analysis, conversion of coordinates, and        visualization of the 3D surface contour map.

Technologies Used:
  - Arduino IDE for microcontroller programming
  - Processing/Matlab for data processing and visualization.
  - Develop algorithms for data conversion and surface contour mapping.

Metodology:

1.  **Experimental Setup**: Three ultrasonic sensors mounted vertically on a stand with equal spacing, connected to a servo motor that can sweep an angle from 0° to 180°, interfaced with an Arduino Uno R3 board.

2.  **Data Collection**: Ultrasonic sensors collect data in cylindrical coordinates, ‘r’ (in cm), Φ(in degrees) - angle swept by the servo motor, ‘z’ is the height of each ultrasonic sensor measured from the bottom of the stand, exploring the environment within a 180° range, incrementing pos by 15º each, transferred to a PC through the Arduino serial port.

4.  **Data Processing**: Real-world 3D coordinates are processed using Processing and Matlab, converting cylindrical coordinates to rectangular form for plotting a 3D scatter plot of the environment.

5.  **Surface Contour Mapping**: A reconstruction process converts the scatter plot into a surface contour map of the scanned 3D environment, enabling visualization of planar surfaces.
