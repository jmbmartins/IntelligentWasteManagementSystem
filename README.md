### Project Overview: Intelligent Waste Management System

#### Problem:

Inefficient waste management leads to environmental pollution, public health risks, and high operational costs due to traditional collection methods.

#### Proposed Solution:

Development of an Intelligent Waste Management System that utilizes IoT (Internet of Things) technology to monitor and optimize waste collection in real-time.

#### Key Components:

1.  Ultrasonic Sensors: Installed in waste bins to measure the fill level.
2.  Microcontroller: Responsible for collecting and processing sensor data.
3.  Connectivity: Use of Wi-Fi to transmit data to a cloud server.
4.  Cloud Server: Stores and analyzes sensor data.
5.  Mobile Application for Residents: Allows residents to locate nearby waste bins, view their fill level, and choose where to dispose of their waste based on occupancy.
6.  Web Dashboard for Waste Management Companies: Provides an overview of all waste bins under the company's responsibility, with detailed information on fill level and collection efficiency reports.

#### Operation:

1.  Ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor the fill level of waste bins.
2.  Data is sent to the microcontroller, which transmits it to the cloud server.
3.  The mobile application enables residents to access real-time information and make informed waste disposal decisions.
4.  Waste management companies use the web dashboard to monitor and optimize collection operations based on real-time sensor data.
5.  Additionally, a panel will be added to the waste bin to indicate the level of filling. This panel will display the following colors, indicating the level of filling:

-   Very low: Green
-   Low: White
-   Moderate: Yellow
-   High: Red

The filling level will be determined based on the data collected by the ultrasonic sensors and will be updated in real-time to provide visual information to residents and waste management personnel.


#### Challenges:

-   Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of ultrasonic sensors.
-   Developing intuitive user interfaces for the mobile application and web dashboard.
-   Integrating the new system with existing waste management systems.
-   Maintaining connectivity and performing adequate system maintenance over time.

#### Expected Benefits:

-   Reduction in environmental pollution and public health risks.
-   Optimization of waste collection operations, leading to cost savings.
-   Active community participation in waste management.
-   Improved transparency and efficiency in urban waste management.

#### Database Design

1.  `Regions` Table:

    -   `RegionID`: a unique identifier for each region (primary key).
    -   `RegionName`: the name of the region.
2.  `Bins` Table:

    -   `BinID`: a unique identifier for each waste bin (primary key).
    -   `RegionID`: an identifier for the region where the waste bin is located (foreign key).
    -   `FillLevel`: the current fill level of the waste bin.

#### Flow of Mobile Application

Here's a general flow of the mobile application:

Based on the information provided and the previous requirements, here's a general flow of your application:

1.  **Start**: The user opens the app.

2.  **User Region Selection**: The user is presented with a list of regions to choose from. They select their region. This happens only on the first interaction with the app.

3.  **Fetch and Display Bins**: The app fetches data about the waste bins in the selected region from the server and displays them in a list. Each bin displays its `BinID` and `FillLevel`.

4.  **Real-Time Bin Status (RF1)**: The status of the bins is updated dynamically as the sensor data changes.

5.  **Bin Details and Navigation (RF2)**: When a user selects a bin from the list or map, the app displays detailed information about the bin, including its location and fill level. The user can also navigate to the selected bin using integrated map services.

6.  **Waste Disposal Selection (RF3)**: The user can select a bin for waste disposal based on its fill level and proximity. The app provides recommendations for the most suitable bin based on real-time occupancy.

7.  **Notifications (RF4)**: The app sends push notifications to the user about critical updates, such as nearby bins reaching maximum capacity or changes in the location of a specific bin. The user can customize their notification preferences.

8.  **End**: The user closes the app.
